/**
 * Archive toggle tests - REMOVED
 *
 * The archive functionality (isArchived field, "Show archived" toggle) has been
 * removed from the data model. The EpicSummary type no longer includes an
 * isArchived field, so there is no archive toggle to test.
 *
 * These tests were previously validating:
 * - Show/hide archive toggle based on presence of archived epics
 * - Default hidden state for archived epics
 * - Toggle behavior to show/hide archived epics
 *
 * All archive-related tests have been removed as part of the data model migration.
