Task initialized: Simplify task-completer agent to become a straightforward orchestrator.
Task type: refactor. Priority: P1 (Critical path for automatic task cleanup feature).
No dependencies - can be developed in parallel with T006 and T007.

Key objectives:
- Remove manual cleanup instructions from task-completer agent
- Update agent to invoke task-merge then task-cleanup sequentially
- Simplify agent description to reflect new responsibility
- Preserve permission prompt before merge

Branch: task-008-refactor. Working in isolated worktree environment.

**Next:** Begin Phase 1: Read and analyze current task-completer.md agent file to understand existing structure
