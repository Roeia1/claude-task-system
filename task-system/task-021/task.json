  "overview": "Create a minimal /dummy-test slash command and its corresponding skill to demonstrate the plugin command/skill pattern. The command will be defined in plugin/commands/dummy-test.md and will activate a skill in plugin/instructions/dummy-test/INSTRUCTIONS.md. When invoked, the skill outputs a simple test message confirming it works. This serves as a reference implementation for creating new commands and skills in the plugin system. The implementation must follow existing patterns from other commands like /init and /task-list.",
