# Test Modification Protocol

This document defines the standard protocol for modifying tests after their initial creation, used across all task-type workflows.

## When Test Modification is Needed

After the initial test creation phase, if a test needs modification:

## Protocol Steps

1. **STOP all work immediately**
2. **Document in journal**:
   - Which test needs changing
   - Why it needs changing
   - What the proposed change would be
3. **Explain to user with clear reasoning**
4. **Wait for explicit permission**
5. **Only proceed with test changes after approval**

## Important Rules

- **NEVER modify tests without explicit user permission**
- Always document the reasoning for test changes
- Test modifications should be rare and well-justified
- When in doubt, discuss with user before proceeding

## Documentation Requirements

When documenting test modification needs:
- Be specific about which test file and test case
- Explain the technical reason the test needs changing
- Propose the exact change you want to make
- Wait for user approval before implementing
